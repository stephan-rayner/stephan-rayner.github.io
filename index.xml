      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;ive-been-lucky&#34;&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve Been Lucky&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, I’ve been incredibly fortunate to work alongside some amazing engineers. The opportunities I had early in my career to learn from these talented people shaped me into the engineer I am today. Beyond their technical skills, their passion for whatever they were teaching lit a spark in me—to pursue my own passions and see the world through a slightly different lens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One moment that stands out was when a senior engineer patiently walked me through how HTTPS works. I remember being blown away—not just by the complexity of the protocol, but by how much care he put into explaining it in a way that made sense to me. That interaction left a lasting impression. It wasn’t just about the technical details; it was about the excitement he felt in sharing something he loved.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
