      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;ive-been-lucky&#34;&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve Been Lucky&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, Iâ€™ve been incredibly fortunate to work alongside some excellent engineers. The opportunities I had early in my career to learn from these talented people shaped me into who I am today. Beyond their technical skills, their passion for what they were teaching made me rethink what it was to be a good engineer. I now believe that engineering (of all kinds) is a much more interpersonal discipline where knowledge sharing should be the principal indicator of a great engineer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
